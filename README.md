# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Python's `tkinter` library. This project demonstrates a basic graphical user interface (GUI) application for playing Tic Tac Toe, where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The game detects when a player wins or if it ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player game with alternating turns between X and O.
- Checks for winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
- Detects a draw when all cells are filled with no winner.
- Displays a message when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
